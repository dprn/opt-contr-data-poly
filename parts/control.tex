\section{Control systems}

\dfn[]{Control system}{
    A control system in $\bbR^n$ is the differential equation 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:cs-edo}
        \dot x = f(t,x,u),
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \emph{state} is a the function $x: \bbR \to \bbR^n$;
        \item $f:\bbR\times \bbR^n \times \bbR^m \to \bbR^n$ is  of class $C^1$ w.r.t.~$(x,u)\in \bbR^n\times \bbR^m$, and locally integrable w.r.t.~$t\in \bbR$;
        \item The \emph{control} $u:\bbR \times U$ is a measurable and essentially bounded function of time, taking values in $U\subset \bbR^m$.
    \end{itemize}

    The control system is 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Linear} is $f(t,x,u) = A(t)x + B(t)u+r(t)$ for $A:\bbR\to \bbR^{n\times n}$, $B:\bbR\to \bbR^{n\times m}$, $r:\bbR\to \bbR^n$. In this case, we assume these functions to be of class $L^\infty$ on every compact interval.
        \item \emph{Autonomous} if $f(t,x,u)=f(x,u)$ is independent of time. Otherwise, the system is \emph{instationary} or \emph{time-varying}.
    \end{itemize}
}

Once a control $u$ and an initial condition $x_0\in\bbR^n$ are fixed, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the non-autonomous equation \eqref{eq:cs-edo} is guaranteed by the following.

\thm[]{CarathÃ©odory Existence Theorem}{
    Consider the Cauchy problem 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:cauchy-prob}
        \begin{cases}
            \dot x = f(t,x),\\
            x(0)=x_0\in \bbR^n.
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Assume that $f:\bbR\times \bbR^n\to \bbR^n$ satisfies the following conditions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f(t,\cdot)$ is Lipschitz continuous for any $t\in \bbR$ with Lispchitz constant $L(t)$ that is locally integrable;
        \item $f(\cdot,x)$ is measurable for any $x\in \bbR^n$;
        \item there exists $r,M>0$ such that $\|f(t,x)\|_2\le M$ for any $(t,x)\in (-r,r) \times B(0,r)$.
    \end{itemize}
    Then, there exists a unique solution to \eqref{eq:cauchy-prob}, maximally defined on some open interval $I\subset\bbR$ such that $0\in \bbR$.
}

When considering the control system on an interval $[0,T]$, we need its solutions to not blow up before the time $T$. 

\dfn[]{Admissible controls}{
    Let $x_0\in \bbR^n$ and $T>0$. A control $u\in L^\infty([0,T],U)$ is \emph{admissible} on $[0,T]$ at $x_0$ if the associated trajectory $x_u$ of \eqref{eq:cs-edo} such that $x_u(0)=x_0$ is well-defined on $[0,T]$.
    We let 
    \begin{equation}
        \mcU_{x_0,T} = \{ u\in L^\infty([0,T],U) \mid u \text{ is admissible} \}.
    \end{equation}
}

\dfn[]{Controllability}{
    The \emph{end-point mapping} $\End_{x_0,T}$ is defined by
    \begin{equation}
        \End_{x_0,T} :\mcU_{x_0,T}\to \bbR^n ,\qquad 
        \End_{x_0,T}(u) = x_u(T).
    \end{equation}
    The \emph{reachable (or accessible) set} from $x_0$ in time $T>0$ is
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \reach_{x_0,T} =\End_{x_0,T}(\mcU_{x_0,T}) .
    \end{eqnarray}

    The system \eqref{eq:cs-edo} is
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Globally controllable} from $x_0$ in time $T>0$ if $\End_{x_0,T}$ is surjective, that is,
              \begin{equation}
                  \reach_{x_0,T}= \bbR^n.
              \end{equation}
        \item \emph{Locally controllable} from $x_0$ in time $T>0$ around $x_1\in \reach_{x_0,T}$ if $x_1$ is in the interior of $\reach_{x_0,T}$. That is, if $\End_{x_0,T}$ is locally surjective near $x_1$.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Controllability of linear autonomous systems}

In this section we consider the linear autonomous control system
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cs-linear}
    \dot x = Ax + Bu.
\end{equation}
It is possible to show that there is no blow-up in finite time for linear systems, and thus $\mcU_{x_0,T} = L^\infty([0,T], U)$.

An essential tool for the study of these systems is the variation of constants formula (or Duhamel formula) for its solutions:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:duhamel-formula}
    x_u(t) = e^{tA}x_0 + \int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}Bu(s)\, ds, 
    \qquad \forall t\in [0,T], \,  u\in L^\infty([0,T], U).
\end{equation}

We also need to recall the following celebrated result.

\thm[cayley-hamilton]{Cayley-Hamilton Theorem}{
    Let $A\in \bbR^{n\times n}$ be a matrix with characteristic polynomial 
    \begin{equation}
        \chi_A(z) = \det(z\idty - A) = z^n + a_1 z^{n-1}+\ldots +a_{n-1}z + a_n.
    \end{equation}
    Then, letting $p_A(A)$ be the number obtained by replacing the unknown $z$ with the matrix $A$ in this expression, we have $p_A(A)=0$. 
    That it,
    \begin{equation}
        A^n + a_1 A^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{n-1} A + a_n =0.
    \end{equation}
}

In the case of linear systems, it turns out that controllability can be verified via a purely algebraic condition.

\dfn[]{Kalman rank condition}{
    We say that the pair $(A,B)\in \bbR^{n\times n}\times \bbR^{n\times m}$ satisfies the \emph{Kalman rank condition} if the Kalman matrix 
    \begin{eqnarray}
        K=[ B, AB, \ldots, A^{n-1}B] \in \bbR^{  n \times nm},
    \end{eqnarray}
    is of maximal rank $n$.
}

\thm[kalman-thm]{Kalman Theorem}{
    Assume that $U=\bbR^n$. Then, \eqref{eq:cs-linear} is controllable from $x_0\in\bbR^n$ and in time $T>0$ if and only if $(A,B)$ satisfies the Kalman rank condition.

    In particular, if a linear system is controllable from $x_0$ in time $T>0$, then it is controllable from any initial point and in any time.
}

\begin{proof}
    By the variation of constants formula \eqref{eq:duhamel-formula}, we see that controllability is equivalent to the surjectivity of the linear operator 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:Lu}
        L : L^\infty([0,T],\bbR^m) \to \bbR^n, 
        \qquad 
        Lu =\int_0^T e^{-As}Bu(s)\, ds .
    \end{equation}
    Here, we used that the exponential matrix $e^{TA}$ is always invertible.

    Let us prove that the fact that $L$ invertible implies $\rank K=n$. We proceed by contradiction and assume that $\rank K<n$. That is, there exists $p\in \bbR^n$, $p\neq 0$, such that 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:AiB}
        p^\top K = 0 
        \iff
        p^\top A^i B = 0, \qquad \forall i\in \llbracket 1,n\rrbracket.
    \end{equation}
    Recall that by Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, we can write $A^j$ as a linear combination of $\idty, A,\ldots, A^{n-1}$. That is, for any $j\in\bbN$, there exists $a_{0},\ldots, a_{n-1}$ such that
    \begin{equation}
        A^j = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i A^i.
    \end{equation}
    This implies that \eqref{eq:AiB} actually holds for any $i\in \bbN$, which yields
    \begin{equation}
        p^\top e^{-As}B =  \sum_{j=0}^{+\infty} p^\top \frac{(-As)^j}{j!}B = 0.
    \end{equation}
    In particular, this shows that $p^\top Lu=0$ for any $u\in L^\infty([0,T],\bbR^m)$ proving that $L$ is not surjective.

    To prove the opposite implication, assume that there exists $p\in \bbR^n$, $p\neq0$, such that 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:pLu}
        p^\top Lu=0\qquad \forall u\in L^\infty([0,T],\bbR^m). 
    \end{equation}
    Consider, for $i\in \llbracket 1,n\rrbracket$ and $\tau\in [0,T]$, the control 
    \begin{equation}
        u(\tau) = 
        \begin{cases}
            e_i, & \text{ if } t\in[0,\tau],\\
            0 & \text{ otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Here, $e_i$ is the $i$-th element of the canonical basis of $\bbR^n$. Thus, we have
    \begin{equation}
        Lu = \int_0^\tau e^{-As}Bu\,ds = \left[\frac{\idty - e^{-\tau A}}{A}\right] B u, \qquad
        \text{where}\qquad 
        \frac{\idty - e^{-\tau A}}{A} = \sum_{j=1}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^{j-1}\tau^j}{j!}A^{j-1}.
    \end{equation}
    Assumption \eqref{eq:pLu} then yields 
    \begin{equation}
       0 = p^\top\left[\frac{\idty - e^{-\tau A}}{A}\right]Bu = \sum_{j=1}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^{j-1}\tau^j}{j!}p^{\top}A^{j-1}Bu , 
       \qquad \forall \tau\in [0,T].
    \end{equation}
    By analyticity\footnote{Equivalently, one can observe that $$0=\frac{d^k}{d\tau^k}\left[\sum_{j=1}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^{j-1}\tau^j}{j!}p^{\top}A^{j-1}Bu\right]_{\tau =0} = p^\top A^{k-1}Bu, \qquad \forall k\in\bbN.$$} w.r.t.~$\tau$ of the right-hand side, this implies that $p^\top A^{j-1}Bu=0$, that is $\rank K<n$.
\end{proof}

\cor[local-contr-with-control-constraint]{Controllability with control constraints}{
    Assume that $0\in \Int(U)$, and that the Kalman condition holds true. Then, the control system is locally controllable around $e^{TA}x_0$ for any $x_0\in \bbR^n$ and any $T>0$. Namely,
    \begin{equation}
        e^{TA}x_0\in \Int\reach(x_0,T) .
    \end{equation}
}

\begin{proof}
    By the variation of constant formula \eqref{eq:duhamel-formula}, we have (for the unconstrained system)
    \begin{equation}
        \End_{x_0,T}(u) = e^{TA}x_0 + Lu,
    \end{equation}
    where $L$ is the operator defined in \eqref{eq:Lu}. 
    Observe that $L$ is a continuous linear map, since 
    \begin{equation}
        \|Lu\|_2 \le T \max_{s\in [0,T]} \|e^{-As}B\| \, \|u\|_\infty.
    \end{equation}
    In particular, $L$ is an open mapping and hence for any neighborhood $V\subset U$ of the origin, we have that $\End_{x_0,T}(V)$ is a neighborhood of $\End_{x_0,T}(0)= e^{TA}x_0\in\reach(x_0,T)$.
\end{proof}


\thm[]{Hautus Test}{
    The following assertions are equivalent 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The pair $(A,B)$ satisfies the Kalman rank condition.
        \item $\rank [\lambda\idty - A, B] = n$ for any $\lambda\in \bbC$.
        \item $\rank [\lambda\idty - A, B] = n$ for any $\lambda\in \Spec A$.
        \item For any eigenvector $z$ of $A^\top$, we have $B^\top z \neq 0$.
        \item There exists $c>0$ such that 
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:lambda-c}
            \|(\lambda\idty - A^\top) z \|_2^2 + \|B^\top z\|_2^2 \ge c\|z\|_2^2, 
            \qquad
            \forall z\in \bbR^n,\, 
            \forall \lambda\in \bbC.
        \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
}

\begin{proof}
    We start by showing the equivalence of assertions 2 to 5.

    \emph{$2\iff 3$} Since $\Spec A \subset \bbC$, we have that assertion 2 implies assertion 3.
    On the other hand, if assertion 3 holds we obtain assertion 2 by recalling that $\lambda\idty - A$ is invertible for any $\lambda \in \bbC\setminus \Spec A$.


    \emph{$3\iff 4$}
    If assertion 4 does not hold for an eigenvector $z$ associated to $\lambda\in \Spec A$, we clearly have $z^\top (\lambda\idty - A)  =z^\top B=0$, which contradicts assertion 3. A similar reasoning shows the opposite implication.

    \emph{$2\iff 5$} If assertion 2 does not hold, we contradict assertion 5 as above. To prove the other implication, let
    \begin{equation}
        M_\lambda = (\bar \lambda\idty - A)(\lambda \idty - A^\top ) + BB^\top.
    \end{equation}
    The matrix $M_\lambda$ is symmetric and it holds
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:lambda-c}
        \|(\lambda\idty - A^\top) z \|_2^2 + \|B^\top z\|_2^2 \ge z^\top M_\lambda z
        \qquad
        \forall z\in \bbR^n.
    \end{equation}
    Hence, letting $\mu(\lambda)$ be the smallest eigenvalue of $M_\lambda$, we have assertion 5 with $c = \inf_{\lambda \in \bbC} \mu(\lambda)$. We have that $c>0$ since $\lambda\mapsto \mu(\lambda)$ is continuous and $\mu(\lambda) \rightarrow + \infty$ as $|\lambda|\to +\infty$.

    \emph{$1\iff 4$}
    We are left to showing that assertion 1 is equivalent to the other equivalent assertions. 
    It is immediate to observe that if assertion 4 does not hold, the same is true for assertion 1. 
    To show the opposite implication,  set
    \begin{equation}
        N = \{ z\in\bbR^n\mid z^\top A^k B = 0\, \forall k\in \bbN\}.
    \end{equation}
    In particular, $N = \{0\}$ if and only if $(A,B)$ satisfies the Kalman rank condition. Assume this is not the case. Then, since $N$ is non-trivial $A^\top$ invariant (i.e., $A^\top N \subset N$) subspace, we have that $A^\top$ has at least one non-zero eigenvalue $z\in N\setminus\{0\}$. But then, $B^\top z=0$ by definition of $N$, contradicting assertion 4.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Similar systems and normal forms}

In this section we look at what happens if we perform a change of basis $x_2 = Px_1$ for some $P\in \operatorname{GL}_2(\bbR)$.

\dfn{Similar systems}{
    The linear control systems 
    \begin{equation}
        \dot x_1 = A_1x_1 + B_1 u_1
        \qquad\text{and}\qquad
        \dot x_2 = A_2x_2 + B_2 u_2,
    \end{equation}
    are \emph{similar} if there exists $P\in \operatorname{GL}_2(\bbR)$ such that $A_2= PA_1P^{-1}$ and $B_2 = PB_1$. 
    In this case we say that the pairs $(A_1,B_1)$ and $(A_2,B_2)$ are similar.
}

Observe that the Kalman property is intrinsic, i.e., is invariant under the similarity transformation $P$.
Indeed, letting $K_1$ and $K_2$ be the Kalman matrices associated to two similar systems, we have $K_2=PK_1$.

An important application of similar systems is the existence of various normal forms, i.e., a change of coordinates (and sometimes a change of inputs) that transforms a nonlinear or linear control system into a simpler, standardized structure, where its controllability, observability, or stabilization properties become explicit.

The following result goes in that direction, and can be seen as an extension of Kalaman Theorem (Theorem~\ref{th:kalman-thm}) to non-controllable systems.

\prop[]{}{
    Consider a linear system \eqref{eq:cs-linear} whose Kalman matrix $K$ satisfies $\rank K = r$. Then, letting $y=(y_1,y_2)^\top\in \bbR^{r\times (n-r)}$, the system is similar to 
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \dot y_1 &=& A_1' y_1 + B_1 u + A_3' y_2 \\
        \dot y_2 &=& A'_2 y_2.
    \end{eqnarray}
    In particular, this splits the original system in a controllable part (the variable $y_1$) and an uncontrollable one (the variable $y_2$).
}

\begin{proof}
    Let us assume that $\rank K < n$, otherwise there is nothing to prove.
    Consider the subspace $F=\operatorname{Ran} K$, and observe that it holds 
    \begin{equation}
        F =\operatorname{Ran} B + \operatorname{Ran} AB + \ldots +\operatorname{Ran} A^{n-1}B.
    \end{equation}
    Then, $\dim F=r$ and, using the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem is straightforward to verify that $F$ is invariant under $A$ (i.e., $AF\subset F$).
    Hence, $\bbR^n = F\oplus G$ for some subspace $G$ such that $\dim G=n-r$.
    Pick   a basis $(f_1,\ldots, f_r)$ of $F$, and a basis $(f_{r+1},\ldots, f_n)$ of $G$, and let $P$ be the matrix encoding the change of basis from $(f_1,\ldots, f_n)$ to the canonical basis of $\bbR^n$.

    Using the invariance of $F$ w.r.t.~$A$, we obtain that 
    \begin{equation}
        A' = PAP^{-1} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
            A_1' & A_3' \\ 
            0 & A_2'
        \end{pmatrix},
    \end{equation}
    where $A_1'\in \bbR^{r\times r}$. Moreover, since $\operatorname{Ran} B \subset F$, we have that 
    \begin{equation}
        B' = P B = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            B_1'\\0
        \end{pmatrix}.
    \end{equation}
\end{proof}

\thm[brunovski-single-input]{Brunovski normal form, single-input case}{
    Consider the linear system \eqref{eq:cs-linear} with scalar input (i.e., $m=1$ so that $B\in \bbR^{n\times 1}$), and assume that $(A,B)$ satisfies the Kalman rank condition.
    Then, letting the characteristic polynomial of $A$ be 
    \begin{equation}
        \chi_A(z) = \det(z\idty - A) = z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{n-1}z + a_n,
    \end{equation}
    the control system is similar to the following chained form 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            \dot x_1 = x_2 \\
            \quad \vdots \\
            \dot x_{n-1} = x_n \\
            \dot x_n = -a_n x_1 - a_{n-1} x_2 -\cdots -a_1 x_n + u.
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show that the pair $(A,B)$ is similar to $(\tilde A, \tilde B)$ given by 
    \begin{equation}
        \tilde A = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            0 & 1 &  \cdots & 0 \\
            \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
            0 & \cdots &  0 & 1 \\
            -a_n & -a_{n-1} &  \cdots & -a_1 
        \end{pmatrix}
        \qquad\text{and}\qquad
        \tilde B = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            0\\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
    \end{equation} 
    
    Let us define the vectors 
    \begin{equation}
        v_n = B, \, v_{n-1} = A B,\, \ldots ,\, v_1 = A^{n-1}B.
    \end{equation}
    These form a basis, since the Kalman matrix $K = [v_n,\ldots, v_1]$ is full rank. 
    By definition of $v_n$ it is immediate to observe that $B$ transforms to $\tilde B$ under the change of basis defined by $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$.

    Let us check that this is true also for $\tilde A$ with respect to $A$.
    By definition, it trivially holds that 
    \begin{equation}
        A v_{j} = A \left(A^{n-j}B\right) = A^{n-(j-1)}B =  v_{j-1}, \qquad \forall j\in \llbracket 2,n\rrbracket.
    \end{equation}
    In other words, in the basis $\{v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$ the matrix $A$ acts as $\tilde A$ on the last $n-1$ coordinates.
    To compute $A v_1$, we apply Cayley-Hamilton Theorem (Theorem~\ref{th:cayley-hamilton}) to obtain
    \begin{equation}
        A v_1 = A^n B = (-a_{1}A^{n-1}- \ldots - a_{n-1}A-a_n)B = -a_1 v_1 - \ldots -a_n v_n.
    \end{equation}
    This shows that indeed $\tilde A$ corresponds to the matrix $A$ under the change of basis $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$. 
\end{proof}

In the general case $m > 1$, the system decomposes into $m$ \emph{controllability chains} (also called \emph{Jordan chains of the couple} $(A,B)$).
This, however, requires to perform also a linear change of input.
More precisely, we have the following.

\thm[]{Brunovski normal form, general case}{
    Consider the linear system \eqref{eq:cs-linear} and assume that $(A,B)$ satisfies the Kalman rank condition.
    Then there exist invertible matrices
    $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ (change of state coordinates)
    and $R \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ (change of input coordinates)
    such that, under the transformations
    \[
        x = P \tilde x,
        \qquad
        u = R \tilde u,
    \]
    the system becomes
    \[
        \dot{\tilde x} = A_c \tilde x + B_c \tilde u,
        \qquad\text{with}\qquad
        A_c = T^{-1} A T,
        \qquad
        B_c = T^{-1} B R.

    Here $(A_c,B_c)$ has the block-diagonal \emph{BrunovskÃ½ form}
    \[
        A_c =
        \begin{bmatrix}

\section{Controllability of time-varying linear systems}

We now turn to time-varying control systems 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cs-linear-time-var}
    \dot x = A(t)x + B(t)u,
\end{equation}
where $A:\bbR \to \bbR^{n\times n}$ and $B:\bbR\to \bbR^{n\times m}$.

\dfn[]{State-transition matrix}{
    The \emph{state-transition matrix} $R:\bbR\times\bbR \to \bbR^{n\times n}$ of sytem $\dot x = A(t)x$ is the unique solution of 
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t} R(t,s) = A(t) R(t,s), \qquad R(s,s) = \idty.
    \end{equation}
}

We have the following standard result.

\prop[state-transition-matrix]{}{
    Let $R$ be the state-transition matrix of $\dot x = A(t)x$. We have
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the autonomous case (i.e., $A(t)\equiv A$), we have $R(t,s) = e^{(t-s)A}$.
        \item Semigroup property: It holds 
        \begin{equation}
            R(t,s)R(s,\tau) = R(t,\tau) \qquad \forall t,s,\tau\in\bbR.
        \end{equation}
        In particular, $R(t,s)^{-1}=R(s,t)$.
        \item Solutions to \eqref{eq:cs-linear-time-var}: For any $x_0\in \bbR^n$, $T>0$, and $u\in \mathcal U_{x_0,T}$, we have 
        \begin{equation}
            x(t) = R(t,0)x_0 + \int_0^t R(t,s)Bu(s)\, ds.
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
}

Due to the time-varying nature of the system, a reasonable generalization of Kalman rank condition would be that the Kalman matrix $K(t)$ of $(A(t),B(t))$ be full rank at each time $t>0$. 
This is however too strong, as the following shows.

\ex[]{}{
    Consider the time-varying linear system with $n=2$ and $m=1$:
    \begin{equation}
        \dot x = B(t)u(t), \qquad
        B(t) =
        \begin{cases}
             (1,0)^\top 
             & \text{ if } t\in [0,1], \\
             (0,1)^\top
             & \text{ if } t>1.
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Since $A(t)=0$ for all times, the instananeous Kalman matrix $K(t)$ is not full-rank. However, it is straightforward to explicitly show that $\reach(x_0,T)=\bbR^2$ for all $T>1$.
}

Indeed, in the time-varying case, the instantaneous lack of controllability for certain directions at a time $t_0$ is not an issue if at later times these directions are controllable. To formalize this idea, we introduce the following.

\dfn[]{Controllability Gramian}{
    The \emph{Gramian matrix} of system \eqref{eq:cs-linear-time-var} at time $T>0$ is the matrix
    \begin{equation}
        G_T := \int_0^T R(T,t)B(t)B(t)^\top R(T,t)^\top \, dt \in \bbR^{n\times n}.
    \end{equation}
}

Before proving the controllability theorem, let us make the following observation.

\prop[gram-matrix-observability]{Observability inequality}{
    Let $T>0$. The Gramian matrix is a symmetric non-negative matrix, whose invertibility is equivalent to the following \emph{observability inequality}: There exists $C_T>0$ such that
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:observability}
        \int_0^T \|B(t)^\top R(T,t)^\top \psi\|_2^2 \, dt \ge C_T \|\psi\|_2^2
        \qquad \forall \psi\in\bbR^n.
    \end{equation}
}

\begin{proof}
    The symmetry of $G_T$ is immediate from the definition. Moreover,
    \begin{equation}
        \psi^\top G_T \psi = \int_0^T \psi^\top R(T,t)B(t) B(t)^\top R(T,t)^\top \psi\, dt = \int_0^T \|B(t)^\top R(T,t)^\top \psi\|_2^2 \, dt \ge 0.
    \end{equation}
    This proves both the non-negativity and the equivalence between the invertibility of $G_T$ and \eqref{eq:observability}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    Inequality \eqref{eq:observability} is called an observability inequality for the following reason. Consider the \emph{adjoint system} to \eqref{eq:cs-linear-time-var}, which is
    \begin{equation}
        \dot z = -A(t)^\top  z, \qquad z(T) = \psi,
    \end{equation}
    and assume that the output $y(t) = B(t)^\top z(t)$ is measured.
    In particular, the energy of this output over $[0,T]$ is the quantity
    \begin{equation}
        E(T) = \int_0^T \|y(t)\|_2^2\, dt.
    \end{equation}
    But, since $y(t) = B(t)^\top R(T,t)^\top \psi$, this coincide with the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:observability}, which can then be recast as
    \begin{equation}
        \int_0^T \|y(t)\|_2^2 \, dt \ge C_T \|z(T)\|_2^2.
    \end{equation}
    Namely, the output $y(t)$ controls the size of the final state $z(T)$.
    In particular, if $y(t)\neq 0$ for all $t\in [0,T]$ we are sure that $z(T)=0$.
    More generally, one can show that this inequality allows to reconstruct the state $z(T)$ from the measurements $y:[0,T]\to \bbR$.
% 
    This property is called \emph{observability of the adjoint system}. 
\end{remark}

The following theorem shows that the observability property introduced above is actually equivalent to the controllability of the original system.

\thm[]{}{
    Assume that $U=\bbR^m$. Then, the control system \eqref{eq:cs-linear-time-var} is controllable from $x_0\in \bbR^n$ in time $T>0$ if and only if the Gramian matrix $G_T$ is invertible.
    In particular, if a linear time-varying system is controllable from $x_0$ in times $T>0$, then it is controllable for any time $T'>T$ and from any initial point.
}

\begin{proof}
    By Proposition~\ref{prop:state-transition-matrix}, given a control $u$ we have that
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:end-point-formula}
        \End_{x_0,T}(u) = x_u(T) = x^\star + Lu,
        \qquad \text{where}\qquad
        x^\star = R(T,0)x_0,
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        Lu = \int_0^T R(T,t)B(t)u(t)\, dt
    \end{equation}


    Assume that $G_T$ be invertible and let us prove that $\End_{x_0,T}$ is surjective (i.e., that the system is controllable).
    Fix $x_1\in \bbR^n$ and let us construct a control $u$  of the form $u(t) = B(t)^\top R(t,T)^\top \psi$ for some $\psi\in \bbR^n$ such that $\End_{x_0,T}(u)=x_1$.
    Since this choice of $u$ implies that $Lu = G_T\psi$, we have
    \begin{equation}
        \End_{x_0,T}(u) = x^\star + G_T \psi.
    \end{equation}
    By invertibility of $G_T$ it then suffices to choose $\psi = G^{-1}_T (x_1-x^\star)$.

    Conversely, let us assume that $G_T$ is not invertible. By Proposition~\ref{prop:gram-matrix-observability} we then have that there exists $\psi\in \bbR^n$, $\psi\neq 0$, such that
    \begin{equation}
        \int_0^T \|B(t)^\top R(T,t)^\top \psi\|_2^2 \, dt = 0
        \implies
        B(t)^\top R(T,t)^\top \psi = 0 \qquad \text{for a.e.\ } t\in [0,T].
    \end{equation}
    It follows that
    \begin{equation}
        \psi^\top Lu = 0,
        \qquad \forall u\in L^\infty([0,T],\bbR^m),
    \end{equation}
    where $L$ is defined in \eqref{eq:end-point-formula}.
    Hence,
    \begin{equation}
        \psi^\top \End_{x_0,T}(u) = \psi^\top (x^\star + Lu) = \psi^\top x^\star, \qquad \forall u \in L^\infty([0,T],\bbR^m).
    \end{equation}
    In particular, the range of $\End_{x_0,T}$ is contained in a proper affine subspace of $\bbR^n$:
    \begin{equation}
        \operatorname{ran}\End_{x_0,T} \subset \{ z \in \bbR^n\mid \psi^\top (z-x^\star) = 0\}.
    \end{equation}
    This contradicts the surjectivity of $\End_{x_0,T}$.
\end{proof}

The same argument used to derive Corollary~\ref{th:local-contr-with-control-constraint} can be used to derive the following.

\cor[]{Controllability with control constraints}{
    Assume that $0\in \operatorname{int}(U)$ and that the Gramian matrix $G_T$ is invertible for some $T>0$. 
    Then, the control system is locally controllable around $x_0\in \bbR^n$ in time $T>0$.
}


We conclude this section by stating a proper generalization of the Kalman rank condition to the time-varying case.

\thm[Time-varying Kalman theorem]{}{
    Consider \eqref{eq:cs-linear-time-var} with $U=\bbR^m$ and such that $t\mapsto A(t)$ and $t\mapsto B(t)$ are of class $C^\infty$.
    Define the sequence of matrices 
    \begin{equation}
        B_0(t) = B(t),
        \qquad 
        B_{j+1} = A(t)B_j(t) - \frac{d}{dt}B_j(t), \qquad j\in \bbN.
    \end{equation}
    Then, the system is controllable if there exists $t_0\in [0,T]$ such that 
    \begin{equation}
        \bigcup_{j\in \bbN} \operatorname{ran} B_j(t_0)= \bbR^n.
    \end{equation}
    If, moreover, $t\mapsto A(t)$ and $t\mapsto B(t)$ are analytic, then the above property is equivalent to controllability and independent of $t_0\in [0,T]$.
